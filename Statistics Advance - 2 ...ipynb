    "#1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
    "#Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions based on data.\n",
    "#It helps us determine whether there's enough evidence in a sample to support a certain belief (hypothesis) about a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#A company claims their battery lasts 10 hours. You test 50 batteries and find an average life of 9.5 hours.\n",
    "#You use hypothesis testing to decide:\n",
    "# Is this difference (0.5 hours) just due to chance, or is the company's claim likely false?\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
    "#Null Hypothesis (H₀): Assumes no effect or no difference. It’s the default assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha): Represents a new claim, suggesting there is an effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#H₀: Battery life = 10 hours\n",
    "#H₁: Battery life ≠ 10 hours (something has changed)\n",
    "#You test to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
    "#Significance Level (α): The threshold for deciding when to reject H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Common values: 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#It tells you how much risk you’re willing to take in rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#If α = 0.05, you accept a 5% risk of concluding there's a difference when there isn't (Type 1 error).\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#The P-value tells you the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as the one you observed, if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Lower P-value = stronger evidence against H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#Compare the P-value to the significance level (α):\n",
    "#If P-value ≤ α: Reject H₀ (evidence supports Ha)\n",
    "#If P-value > α: Fail to reject H₀ (not enough evidence)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#P-value = 0.03, α = 0.05 → Reject H₀\n",
    "#P-value = 0.08, α = 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#Type I Error (False Positive): Rejecting a true null hypothesis\n",
    "# Risk = α (significance level)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Type II Error (False Negative): Failing to reject a false null hypothesis\n",
    "# Risk = β (depends on sample size and effect size)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#Type I: You say the battery is faulty, but it's actually fine.\n",
    "#Type II: You say the battery is fine, but it’s actually faulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#One-Tailed Test: Tests in one direction only (greater than or less than)\n",
    "#H₁: μ > μ₀ or μ < μ₀\n",
    "#Two-Tailed Test: Tests in both directions (difference only)\n",
    "#H₁: μ ≠ μ₀\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#One-tailed: “The battery lasts less than 10 hours.”\n",
    "#Two-tailed: “The battery life is not equal to 10 hours.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#Z-test is used when:\n",
    "#Population standard deviation (σ) is known\n",
    "#Sample size is large (n ≥ 30)\n",
    "#It compares the sample mean to the population mean to check if there's a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "Z-score formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z= σ/ n X−μ\n",
    "\n",
    " = sample mean\n",
    " μ = population mean\n",
    " σ = population standard deviation\n",
    " n = sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "#It tells how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10. What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
    "#Use T-distribution when:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Sample size is small (n < 30)\n",
    "#Population standard deviation is unknown\n",
    "#It is similar to the normal distribution but has fatter tails, which gives more accurate results for small samples.\n",
    "#11. What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Z-test\tT-test\n",
    "#Known σ\tUnknown σ\n",
    "#Large n (≥30)\tSmall n (<30)\n",
    "#Uses normal distribution\tUses t-distribution\n",
    "#12. What is the T-test, and how is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#T-test compares means to determine if there's a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Types:\n",
    "#One-sample t-test: Compare sample mean vs known value\n",
    "#Two-sample t-test: Compare two sample means\n",
    "#Paired t-test: Compare before/after for same group\n",
    "\n",
    "#13. What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "#Both test whether means differ significantly, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Z-test assumes more info (known σ)\n",
    "#T-test is more flexible and used more often when σ is unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "#As sample size increases, t-distribution → normal distribution, so t-test and z-test results become similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#14. What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
    "#A confidence interval (CI) gives a range of values where the true population parameter is likely to fall.\n",
    " #For a 95% CI, it means:\n",
    "#“We are 95% confident the true value lies within this interval.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#Sample mean = 9.5 hours\n",
    "#95% CI = (9.2, 9.8) → The true battery life is likely between 9.2 and 9.8 hours.\n",
    "#If the claimed value (e.g., 10) is outside the CI, it suggests a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
    "# Margin of Error (MoE):\n",
    "#It represents the range of uncertainty around a sample estimate (like mean or proportion).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Formula:\n",
    "#Margin of Error\n",
    "=𝑍𝛼/2⋅(𝜎𝑛)\n",

    "CI=𝑋 ±\n",
    "Margin of Error\n",
    "CI= X ±Margin of Error\n",
    "Larger MoE → wider confidence interval (less precision)\n",
    "Smaller MoE → narrower interval (more precision)\n",
